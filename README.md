for the advancement of space exploration!

There are thousands of other planets out there! We have eight planets in our Solar System. However, outside of our Solar System there are thousands of other planets. The extra-solar planets or exo-planets are in orbit around another star. So far, we have almost 1,800 confirmed new worlds, with another 3,000 awaiting confirmation. Astronomers are looking to a star’s goldilocks zone for planets that may be habitable, just like the Earth.
